              <p>
                We are a non profit animal shelter our business is dependent on adoption fees and donations. In our shelter we house dogs, cats, horses and other animals. We also offer dog training classes for new pet owners
              </p>
              <h3 id="adopt">How to adopt a pet</h3>
              <p>
                First, find the pet you want and then you set up an appointment with a staff member. To set up an appointment you can click adopt pet and then fill out the necessary forms online then you will be given the time to speak with our staff at the shelter. Or you can set up an appointment through email or by phone if you prefer. You can call this number 555-555-5555 or use this email animalshelter@gamil.com to talk to an employee.

              </p>
              <h3 id="rehome-a-pet">Rehome a pet</h3>
              <p>
                In order to rehome a pet you have to schedule an appointment with one of our staff members. Once you have an appointment, bring your pet to the shelter and the shelter employee will decide whether or not to take the pet in.
              </p>
              <h3 id="volunteer">Volunteering</h3>
              <p>
                Our animal shelter relies heavily on volunteers in order to function. If you are interested in helping out or want to meet other people who have a similar interest in animals then we encourage you to sign up

              </p>
              <h4>Volunteer positions</h4>
              <p>There are a variety of volunteer positions to meet the interests of every volunteer</p>
              <h5>Cat socialization</h5>
              <p>
                Exercise and socializing is an important part of a cat's needs while they are living in an animal shelter. What volunteers for this position will be doing is letting cats out to play, be brushed, given treats, and played with. This job takes place anywhere between 8am - closing time which is 5pm. Volunteers can show at any time between this range as long as they spend at least two hours a week with the cats.
              </p>
              <h5>Cat socialization</h5>
              <p>
                In an animal shelter environment it is important to interact with our dogs to keep them sand and happy. Giving social stimulation to dogs will make them much less prone to aggression from being cooped up all the time. Volunteers for this position will take the dogs out into the grass field and play with them. We have tennis balls, tug toys and other things for the dogs to play with. Ideally the dogs in our shelter will get out three times a day to keep them happy.
              </p>
              <h5>Community outreach</h5>
              <p>
                We always need help with getting the word out to the public about our work. Volunteers take animals into nursing homes and other outreach events. If you are interested then you can contact us at our email or phone number.

              </p>
              <h5>Fundraising and events</h5>
              <p>
                Because we are a non profit shelter we rely mostly on donations. At these events volunteers can be asked to do any number of different tasks.
              </p>
              <h5>Front desk volunteer</h5>
              <p>
                Our front desk is the first thing that customers will interact with and is usually busy. Volunteers will help with filing, data entry, returning phone calls, making copies, and answering phone calls
              </p>
              <h5>Morning cleaning assistant</h5>
              <p>
                Every morning our volunteers clean all the kennels and give the animals clean blankets, food, water, and toys. Volunteers can sign up to clean either cat or dogs. This process is done daily from 7 to 10am.
              </p>
              <h5>Yard work</h5>
              <p>
                There is always yard work to be done. Volunteers pick weeds, mow the grass, trim bushes, wash the dog, pick up trash and much more.
              </p>
